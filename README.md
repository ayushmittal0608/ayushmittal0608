🛠️ **Currently working on:** A **Cloud Cost Optimization Dashboard** that addresses a key business pain point — AWS and other cloud services don’t provide billing details in INR. My project aggregates and converts cloud costs (AWS, Azure) into a unified dashboard with INR support, helping Indian users track and optimize multi-cloud spending more effectively.

🎯 Actively seeking a role at a **product-based company** where I can learn, grow with the team, and make meaningful contributions—building expertise and impact year after year.
